      <h5 class="card-title">1. Labrador Retriever</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Labrador Retrievers are famous for thier friendliness. A medium-sized dog that can reach to over two feet tall at the shoulder, the Labrador Retriever are sturdy and well balanced dogs that could weigh up to 80 pounds. They are known to socialize incredibly well with both people and other canines, which may fool people into believing these dogs may be more suitable for laying around the house then spending time running around a field. Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your schedule, Labs are incredible athletes and require regular exercise to keep them mentally and physically healthy.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">2. French Bulldog</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The most popular of small-dog breeds, the French Bulldog barely reaches over a foot of height at the shoulders when they are fully grown. They are smart dogs with an affectionate personality that don't require much exercise. Coupled along with thier relatively aloof personality and quiet demeanor (they don't bark much), Frenchies are common pets in big and cramped cities where space and noise may be an issue.</p>
      <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">Quiet</small></p>

      <h5 class="card-title">3. Golden Retriever</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Everything that can be said about Labs can be said about Golden Retrievers. THe only real differences are physical, with Golden Retrievers being slightly smaller and needing more frequent grooming due to thier longer and softer fur.</p>
      <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">Doesn't Need as much exercise as Labs</small></p>

      <p class="card-text">Considered an all-purpose dog, German Shepherds are large and brave dogs. Despite thier size, reaching up to 26 inches at the shoulder, German Shepherds are able to reach great speeds. Experts say that the defining attributes of these dogs are bravery and loyalty, with the ability to stand up in the defense of thier loved ones.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">5. Poodle</h5>
      <p class="card-text">More of an aristocrat's dog, Poodles stand proudly as a fancy and curly haired athlete and friend. They tend to come in three sizes, with the standard poodles reaching over 15 inches at the shoulder and the smallest (Toys) reaching no more than 10. Poodles are incredibly intelligent and can be trained with great success, making them common show dogs.</p>
